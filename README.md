## execOnFocus

This small addon filters commands to ensure they are only executed when the game window is in focus.

It was designed for setups that involve certain input devicesâ€”ones whose inputs are detected by **all** running instances of the game, not just the focused one. Without filtering, a single input could trigger commands in multiple instances.

With this addon, commands will only be triggered if the game is currently focused.

**Example devices:** [Windower Binder-compatible devices](https://docs.windower.net/plugins/binder/)

### How to Use

To use this addon, prefix your command with `exof` (short for `execOnFocus`). This ensures the command runs **only when the game is focused**.

**Example:**

```bash
alias g600_M1G9 exof input /echo Key M1G9 Pressed.;
```

In this example, the command `/echo Key M1G9 Pressed.` will only be executed if the game window is currently active.
